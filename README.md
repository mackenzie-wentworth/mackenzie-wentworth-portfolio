## User Story

```md
AS AN industry professional seeking a candidate in web developement, 
I WANT to view a candidate's deployed portfolio that highlights who they are, their project history, and contact information
SO THAT I can evaluate the candidate's eligibility for an available position
```


## Installation

To create my portfolio, I cloned the **Resume** template provided by **Start Bootstrap** and tailored the design with a personal touch for my final product.
